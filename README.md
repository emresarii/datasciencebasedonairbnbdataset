# For this project, we worked on the Airbnb New York dataset. Airbnb shares annual
datasets for each city every year. Besides, all of these datasets are open-sourced. Our
main goal for the classification is to predict price with categorical features.


So we have 16 columns/features, 10 of them are numerical (int64 and float), 6 of them
are string(object) values, and 48895 rows on this dataset.


# The rest of the analytics stands on the pdf file!
